# PyClicker
This is a simple autoclicker that uses hotkeys to click. You can set the speed in milleseconds and it will click at that speed as long as you hold down the button.

<h>NOTICE:
  This uses a virtual environment, but can work without one. If using an IDE, you can set the interpreter to be the one inside "venv\Scripts"

<h>REQUIREMENTS:
  * Keyboard module
  * PySimpleGui module
  * Pynput module

<h>DIRECTIONS:
* Enter speed and hotkey
* Press "Start"

In order to reset the hotkey and timing to enter them again, press "Reset", change the values, and press "Start"
